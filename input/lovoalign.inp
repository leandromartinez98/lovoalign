# LovoAlign.sh script input file example
#

# PDB file of first protein (the one that will be "moved")
proteinA proteinA.pdb

# Atoms to be aligned on first protein
selA chain A and name CA

# PDB file of the second protein
proteinB proteinB.pdb

# Atoms to be aligned in the second protein
selB chain B and name CA

# File name (PDB) for the output file, containing the first
# protein aligned to the second protein
output AalignedtoB.pdb

# Gap: The greater this number, the lower the number of gaps
# of the alignment (generally 0. for the NON-BIJECTIVE score)
gap 10.

# Type of score: 
# 1: Structal Score. 
# 2: TM-Score 
# 3: TRIANGULAR SCORE 
# 4: NON-BIJECTIVE TRIANGULAR SCORE (for non-sequential alignments)
score 1

# Path to temporary files (default is current directory)
tmp .

# Supress writing of bijection (true/false)
seqoff false
